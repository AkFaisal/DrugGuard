Product Name: Drug Guard - A Blockchain based Supply Chain Management to Prevent Counterfeit Drugs

The production and distribution of counterfeit drugs are critical and progressively becoming a major issue in the world. One of the main reasons behind drug counterfeiting is the imperfect supply chain. It is difficult to track over the drugs from manufacturing to distribution where manufacturer cannot keep track over their drugs, pharmacist don’t know the origin of drugs and it doesn’t provide visibility. Also, many death records are found. So, we are proposing a blockchain based supply chain where the security of information, traceability over drugs and transparency are ensured and an encrypted QR code for the security of DAR number so that frauds cannot make a duplicate of it.
